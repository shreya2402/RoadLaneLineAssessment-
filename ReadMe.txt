Driver support system is one of the most important features of the modern vehicles to
ensure driver safety and decrease vehicle accident on roads. Apparently, the road lane detection
or road boundaries detection is the complex and most challenging tasks. It is including the
localization of the road and the determination of the relative position between vehicle and road.
A vision system using on-board camera looking outwards from the windshield is presented in
this project. The system acquires the front view using a camera mounted on the vehicle and
detects the lanes by applying few processes. The algorithm extensively uses image processing
library ‘OpenCV’ for its implementation. The proposed lane detection system can be applied on
both painted and unpainted roads as well as curved and straight road in different weather
conditions. The proposed system does not require any extra information such as lane width,
time to lane crossing and offset between the centre of the lanes. The system was investigated
under various situations of changing illumination, and shadows effects in various road types
without speed limits. The system has demonstrated a robust performance for detecting the road
lanes under different conditions.
